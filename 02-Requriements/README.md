What is snakes and ladders?
Snakes and ladders is an ancient Indian board game that’s regarded today as a worldwide classic. It requires two or more players and takes place on a board with numbered, gridded squares. Throughout the board, there are snakes and ladders which connect different squares. Players roll a die and navigate the board. Landing on a ladder advances a player to a square further up the board, while landing on a snake means they have to go back to a previous square.

The aim of the game is to reach the final square. The game is a race that’s based on sheer luck, and is popular with children.

#Snakes and ladders history - Origins

The history of snakes and ladders can be traced back to ancient India, where it was known as Mokshapat or Moksha Patamu. Some people think it was invented by Hindi spiritual leaders, although this is unclear. The game is thought to have been played as early as the second century B.C.

The game functioned as a moral guide for children: the squares that included ladders represented virtues, while the squares that featured snakes represented evils. Progression up the board represented a life journey. Ladders symbolised good deeds like kindness, faith and humility, while snakes stood for bad deeds like anger, murder and theft.

The game carried a moral message: that salvation is attainable through righteous deeds, while evil deeds lead to rebirth in lower forms of life. This was echoed in the imagery that sometimes adorned the boards. The top of the boards were often decorated with gods, angels and other majestic beings, while the bottom featured humans, animals and flowers.

In the original Hindu game, snakes outnumbered ladders, signifying that a moral path is more difficult to traverse than a life of bad deeds.

#Snakes and ladders history - English adaptation

In the latter part of the 19th century, colonial rulers transported a modified version of the game to England. Indian vices and virtues were adapted to reflect Victorian notions of morality.

Ladders of thrift, penitence and industry led to squares of fulfilment, grace and success, while illness, disgrace and poverty were found at the bottom of snakes on indulgence, disobedience and indolence.

The English version featured an equal number of snakes and ladders, symbolising the idea that for each sin, there exists an opportunity for redemption. Eventually, the game was stripped of its moral and religious undertones

In 1943, a US version of the game called Chutes and Ladders was created by Milton Bradley.

#Snakes and ladders instructions:

Each player begins with a token or figure on the ‘1’ square in the bottom left-hand corner of the board.
Players take turn rolling a die and moving their token in accordance with the number they roll. If they roll a one they move one square; if they roll a two they move two squares, and so on.
If a player lands on the lower end of a ladder, they ‘climb’ that ladder to the square that features its top end.
Conversely, if players land on the higher-numbered square of a snake, they fall down to its lowest-numbered square. If a player rolls a six, they get another roll after moving their token. To speed up the game, players can use two dice.
Whoever reaches the last square first is the winner.
